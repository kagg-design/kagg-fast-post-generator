# KAGG Generator

The plugin generates posts/pages. Useful to generate millions of records in wp_posts table.

In WordPress development, sometimes it is needed to generate big databases with hundreds of thousands of posts/pages. Existing plugins can generate test content, but very slowly, with the usual rate of 1,000 posts per hour.

The Fast Post Generator plugin is able to generate millions of posts/pages in minutes.
